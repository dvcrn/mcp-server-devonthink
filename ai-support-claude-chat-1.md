I've recently added some ai capabilities to the devonthink mcp server. Can you tell me what you see?

The user is asking about AI capabilities they've added to the DEVONthink MCP server. Let me look through the available DEVONthink functions to see what AI-related capabilities are available.

Looking through the DEVONthink functions, I can see several AI-powered capabilities:

chat_with_knowledge_base - This appears to be a flagship AI tool for conversational access to the document collection. It allows natural language questions and gets intelligent responses based on DEVONthink documents. It supports multiple AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and different conversation modes.
extract_keywords - Intelligent keyword and tag extraction from documents using DEVONthink's built-in analysis capabilities.
analyze_document_themes - Advanced thematic analysis for deeper content understanding and conceptual insight. It can perform multi-dimensional analysis including concepts, topics, sentiment, and comprehensive thematic analysis.
find_similar_documents - Advanced semantic document discovery using AI-powered semantic analysis to identify documents with similar content, concepts, or themes.
classify - Uses DEVONthink's AI to suggest appropriate groups or tags for organizing records.
compare - Compare DEVONthink records to find similarities, with support for different comparison types.
These are significant AI enhancements to the DEVONthink MCP server that enable intelligent document analysis, organization, and discovery.

Looking at the DEVONthink MCP server functions, I can see you've added some impressive AI capabilities! Here are the key AI-powered features I can access:

Chat with Knowledge Base (chat_with_knowledge_base)
This appears to be the flagship AI feature - it enables natural language conversations with your entire document collection. I can:

Ask questions and get AI-powered responses based on your documents
Use different AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
Work in different modes: context-aware responses, direct document analysis, or summarization
Search across entire databases or specific folders
Control response creativity and format
Document Theme Analysis (analyze_document_themes)
Advanced thematic analysis that goes beyond simple keywords to identify:

Concepts, topics, and sentiment patterns
Multi-dimensional analysis with confidence scores
Thematic relationships and hierarchies
Actionable recommendations for document organization
Intelligent Keyword Extraction (extract_keywords)
Smart keyword and tag extraction using DEVONthink's analysis engine:

Extracts keywords from content, hashtags, images, and barcodes
Optional auto-tagging capabilities
Relevance scoring and frequency data
Semantic Document Discovery (find_similar_documents)
AI-powered similarity search to find related documents using:

Semantic analysis (meaning and context)
Textual comparison
Conceptual relationships
Mixed algorithm approaches
AI Classification & Comparison
Classify (classify) - AI suggestions for organizing documents into appropriate groups or tags
Compare (compare) - Find similarities between documents using various comparison methods
These tools transform DEVONthink from a document manager into an intelligent knowledge assistant that can understand content, find patterns, and help with organization and discovery. The integration looks very powerful - you can now have actual conversations with your document collection and get AI-powered insights!

Would you like to try out any of these capabilities with your documents?

summarize_contents is also a new one

Thought process
The user is pointing out that I missed summarize_contents as one of the new AI capabilities. Let me look through the functions again to find it.

Looking through the functions... I don't actually see a function called summarize_contents in the list. Let me double-check...

No, I don't see summarize_contents in the function list provided. The user says it's a new one, so perhaps:

It might be part of another function's capabilities
It might be named differently
It might not be showing up in my function list for some reason
I should acknowledge what the user said while being honest about what I can see in my available functions.

You're right! I apologize for missing that one. However, I'm not seeing a summarize_contents function directly in my available DEVONthink functions list. It's possible that:

It might be integrated as part of another function (perhaps within chat_with_knowledge_base which has a "summarize" mode)
It could be named differently in my function interface
It might not be fully exposed through the MCP server yet
The functions I can see with AI/summarization capabilities are:

chat_with_knowledge_base - which has a summarize mode for creating summaries of relevant information
analyze_document_themes - which can provide narrative summaries of thematic content
extract_keywords - for extracting key terms and concepts
Could you tell me more about the summarize_contents feature? Is it a standalone function for summarizing individual documents or collections? I'd love to learn more about how it works, even if I might not have direct access to it through my current function interface.

I've been adding new capabilities to the devonthink mcp server. Can you work through these and see if they work as expected? You might find lots of interesting stuff in the GTD Reference database, for example. Here's a description of the feature: Chat with Knowledge Base The flagship AI tool that enables conversational access to your entire document collection. I can: * Ask natural language questions about your documents * Get context-aware responses using your documents as background knowledge * Choose between different AI engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) * Search across entire databases or scope to specific folders * Use different modes: context-aware responses, direct document analysis, or summarization

Edit

Thought process
The user is asking me to test out a new feature they've added to their DEVONthink MCP server - specifically the "Chat with Knowledge Base" feature. They mentioned there might be interesting stuff in the GTD Reference database.

Let me start by exploring what databases are available and then try out the chat_with_knowledge_base feature to see if it works as expected. I'll test various aspects of it to ensure it's functioning properly.

First, let me check what databases are available.

I'd be happy to help test the new Chat with Knowledge Base feature you've added to the DEVONthink MCP server! Let me start by exploring what databases you have available and then test the conversational AI capabilities.

Probed GTD Reference database for conversational knowledge retrieval.


Excellent! I can see you have 6 databases available, including the GTD Reference database you mentioned. Let me test the Chat with Knowledge Base feature by asking some natural language questions about your documents.

Let me start by exploring what's in your GTD Reference database:

Probed knowledge base feature, tested multiple interaction strategies

Great! The Chat with Knowledge Base feature is working beautifully! It found 13 relevant documents and provided a comprehensive overview showing your GTD Reference database contains a rich collection of management theory, computer science, organizational design, and professional development materials.

Now let me test a more specific query about one of the interesting topics I noticed - the Agile/Scrum critique:

D


chat_with_knowledge_base



Pondered AI engine configuration and testing strategies.

}

Strategized alternative method to access DevonThink documents.

I see that the AI services need to be configured in DEVONthink preferences. Let me try a different approach and explore the content using the search and document retrieval features instead:

Unearthed document about Agile and Scrum methodology.

}
Response

Error executing code: MCP error -32603: MCP error -32603: JXA execution failed: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded

Probed document retrieval and explored folder structure strategically.

The document seems to be quite large. Let me explore the folder structure and test the scoping feature by looking at what's in the Professional folder:

Good! I found the Professional folder.

Ed.)”\n\n• Management’s nature  \n  – It is the “constitutive organ of the Society of Organizations,” a distinct discipline and a liberal art that integrates values, people and power, not merely business technique. [6]  \n  – An enterprise is a human system; its parts are inter-dependent, so the whole, not local efficiency, is the performance yard-stick. [10]\n\n• Three universal managerial responsibilities  \n  1. Performance of the institution (setting mission, objectives, strategy, results)  \n  2. Making work productive and the worker achieving  \n  3. Managing social impacts and social responsibilities [9]\n\n• Spirit of Performance  \n  – The cultural core of high-performing organizations: integrity, results-focus, building on strengths, meeting stakeholder requirements and “leading beyond borders.” [11]  \n\n• Theory of the Business  \n  – Every organization needs an explicit, testable “theory” that answers: What is our mission? core competencies? customers & non-customers? results? what should our theory become?  It must be continually tested against reality and revised. [12]\n\n• Management in a changing environment  \n  – Executives must read “the future that has already happened”: knowledge work, ageing demographics, globalization, information technology—all shift opportunities and dictate new strategies and structures. [12-14]\n\n• Innovation & entrepreneurship as ongoing tasks  \n  – Creative destruction is constant; managers must systematically search for and exploit opportunities, abandon the obsolete and institutionalise entrepreneurship (Part VIII, summarized in 14).\n\n• Social impacts & the common good  \n  – Ethical rule: primum non nocere—first, do no harm.  \n  – Two duties: (a) prevent or rectify negative impacts; (b) convert social ills into opportunities (e.g., GE’s “green” businesses). [13-14]  \n  – Voluntary self-regulation is preferable to externally imposed regulation. [13]\n\n• Managerial work & skills  \n  – Effective decision making, people decisions, communication, control, budgeting and information tools (Parts VI-VII).  \n  – Management by objectives & self-control links individual work to organizational results. [6 table of contents]  \n  – From hierarchy to information-based, team-oriented structures (Part IX).\n\n• Managing oneself  \n  – In the knowledge society career success depends on knowing one’s strengths, preferred ways of work, values, contribution and relationships (“Managing Oneself,” Ch. 45).\n\nOverall insight: management is holistic. Only by integrating mission, strategy, people, culture, innovation, social responsibility and personal effectiveness can an organization deliver results and contribute to society.",

Church](x-devonthink-item://E53F95E2-30E5-4CFB-A81F-F74111D1FC35)\n\n**Agile vs. Waterfall is a false dichotomy**: Both models often result in business-driven engineering that strips engineers of authority and hampers quality.\n\n**Scrum originated as crisis management**: Designed for short-term “war room” emergencies, Scrum is harmful when imposed as a permanent process.\n\n**Violent transparency undermines creativity**: Daily stand-ups, open offices and constant status tracking create anxiety, reduce deep work and erode trust.\n\n**Two-week sprints cause terminal juniority**: Endless focus on small “user stories” blocks long-term R&D, architecture work and real career growth.\n\n**Short-term bias breeds technical debt**: Pressure to show sprint progress discourages refactoring and strategic investment, letting problems fester.\n\n**Career incoherency demotivates talent**: Atomized tasks deny engineers ownership and make résumés look like lists of trivial tickets.\n\n**Surveillance targets “slackers” but backfires**: Scrum’s visibility aims to expose low performers yet mainly stresses or drives away high performers.\n\n**Whisky-Goggles Effect lowers team caliber**: Aggressive oversight can nudge weak engineers to mediocrity while pushing 7-to-9-level talent to quit.\n\n**Open-plan and Agile culture repel experts**: Trendy layouts and process zeal signal low status for engineers, deterring seasoned professionals.\n\n**Scrum consulting is sold dishonestly**: Vendors market crisis tactics as universal cures, creating a cottage industry that feeds on managerial fear.\n\n**Engineer-driven companies work better**: When engineers set priorities and own outcomes, software quality, motivation and retention improve.\n\n**Call to abandon permanent Scrum**: Use emergency processes only for true crises; otherwise foster autonomy, long-horizon planning and technical excellence.\n\n# [Serving the Customer of the Customer](x-devonthink-item://51FAC6EA-4D1F-4915-B771-A8A9AA9132BE)\n\n**Research Focus**: Investigates how communication, trust, mutuality and other relational elements build collaboration with channel partners in B2B2C settings.\n\n**B2B2C Definition**: A model combining B2B and B2C in which businesses jointly serve end-customers to enhance customer experience through mutually beneficial collaboration.\n\n**Key Challenge**: Greatest risk is channel conflict—partners may feel bypassed when the focal firm starts addressing end-customers directly.\n\n**Relational Elements**: Communication, trust and mutuality are critical; loyalty emerged as an additional essential factor.\n\n**Communication Role**: Requires intensive, multi-level information exchange and clear explanation of the B2B2C approach to partners.\n\n**Trust Mechanism**: Prefer self-enforcing, non-contractual agreements; fostered by permanent partnerships and stable teams.\n\n**Mutuality Practices**: Provide partners with both financial and non-financial benefits; develop shared visions and joint objectives.\n\n**Loyalty Tools**: Step-by-step implementation and loyalty programs encourage partner commitment to the new model.\n\n**Initiative Variance**:  \n• Focal-company-initiated B2B2C—emphasis on communication and loyalty to convince partners.  \n• Partner-initiated B2B2C—emphasis on trust and shared vision; communication mainly supports trust-building.\n\n**Empirical Work**: Multiple-case study of three companies; twelve interviews confirm high relevance of the four relational elements.\n\n**Theoretical Contribution**: Proposes a three-model framework distinguishing basic, platform and intermediary forms of B2B2C.\n\n**Practical Implication**: Firms should tailor communication, trust-building, mutual benefits and loyalty programs to the origin of the B2B2C initiative to avoid channel conflict and improve collaboration.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Source Documents\n\n1. **Peter_F_Drucker_Management_Rev_Ed** (/Inbox/)\n2. **Why “Agile” and especially Scrum are terrible – Michael O.

Probed potential connection issues with advanced DevonThink features.

Let me verify the AI chat feature is still working:

D


get_chat_response
Request

{
  `mode`: `context`,
  `engine`: `ChatGPT`,
  `message`: `What is the main focus of the Theory of Constraints methodology?`,
  `temperature`: 0.5,
  `outputFormat`: `text`
}
Response

{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Identifying and systematically improving the single most limiting bottleneck (“constraint”) in a process so the whole system’s throughput increases.",
  "usage": {
    "engine": "ChatGPT"
  }
}

Probed AI features, noted functionality gaps in testing.

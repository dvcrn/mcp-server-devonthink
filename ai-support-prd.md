# AI Support Feature - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Feature**: AI-Powered Knowledge Base Integration for DEVONthink MCP Server
**Goal**: Transform the MCP server from a basic document interface into an intelligent knowledge management platform
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Impact**: Enable Claude to leverage DEVONthink's built-in AI for semantic search, content analysis, and intelligent document discovery

## Problem Statement

Currently, when users interact with their DEVONthink database through Claude, they face these limitations:

1. **Manual Document Discovery**: Users must manually find and reference specific documents
2. **No Semantic Understanding**: Claude can't discover related documents or understand document relationships
3. **Limited Content Analysis**: No automatic extraction of key themes, summaries, or insights from document collections
4. **Fragmented Workflows**: Research and knowledge work requires constant context switching between Claude and DEVONthink

**The Core Issue**: Claude is "blind" to the user's knowledge base and can't leverage DEVONthink's sophisticated AI capabilities for document intelligence.

## Solution Overview

### What We're Building
An AI integration layer that gives Claude access to DEVONthink's built-in artificial intelligence capabilities, enabling:

- **Semantic Document Discovery**: Find related documents based on content similarity
- **Intelligent Content Analysis**: Extract summaries, keywords, and key themes
- **Knowledge Base Conversations**: Ask questions that span across entire document collections
- **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Get suggestions based on document usage patterns and relationships

### How It Works
```
User: "Help me prepare for my climate presentation"
    ↓
Claude: Uses DEVONthink AI to search knowledge base
    ↓  
DEVONthink AI: Finds related docs, extracts key themes
    ↓
Claude: Synthesizes findings with own knowledge
    ↓
Result: Comprehensive presentation prep with your research
```

## Key Features

### Phase 1: Core AI Integration (3-4 weeks)
1. **`chat_with_knowledge_base`** - Ask questions that search across all documents
2. **`summarize_content`** - Generate summaries using DEVONthink's AI
3. **`extract_keywords`** - Auto-generate tags and keywords from documents
4. **`find_similar_documents`** - Discover related content based on semantic similarity

### Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence (2-3 weeks) 
5. **`classify_document`** - Get AI suggestions for document organization
6. **`analyze_document_themes`** - Extract key themes and concepts
7. **`compare_documents`** - Analyze similarities and differences between documents

### Phase 3: Knowledge Work Automation (1-2 weeks)
8. **`research_topic`** - Comprehensive topic research across knowledge base
9. **`generate_reading_list`** - Create curated document recommendations
10. **`track_document_relationships`** - Map connections between documents

## User Stories

### Research Workflows
- **As a researcher**, I want Claude to find all relevant documents when I'm working on a topic, so I don't miss important context
- **As an academic**, I want to generate literature reviews from my document collection, so I can quickly synthesize my research
- **As a consultant**, I want to find similar past projects when starting new work, so I can leverage previous insights

### Content Analysis
- **As a knowledge worker**, I want automatic summaries of long documents, so I can quickly understand key points
- **As a writer**, I want to identify key themes across my notes, so I can structure my work effectively
- **As a student**, I want to extract important concepts from my readings, so I can focus my studying

### Knowledge Discovery
- **As a researcher**, I want to discover unexpected connections between documents, so I can find new insights
- **As a professional**, I want document recommendations based on what I'm currently working on, so I can access relevant context
- **As a librarian**, I want to understand document relationships in large collections, so I can improve organization

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Usage**: >50% of MCP sessions use at least one AI feature within 4 weeks of launch
- **Efficiency**: 30% reduction in time spent manually searching for documents
- **Discovery**: Users find 2x more relevant documents per research session

### Qualitative  
- **User Feedback**: "This feels like having an AI research assistant"
- **Workflow Integration**: Users report seamless integration into existing knowledge work
- **Value Perception**: Users identify AI features as primary value of MCP server

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: AI queries complete within 10 seconds for typical document collections
- **Reliability**: 99% success rate for AI tool calls
- **Scalability**: Support databases with 10,000+ documents without performance degradation

### Integration
- **DEVONthink Compatibility**: Works with DEVONthink Pro 3.9+
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when AI services unavailable
- **Security**: All AI processing happens locally within DEVONthink

### User Experience
- **Discoverability**: Clear tool descriptions help users understand capabilities
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent response formats and error messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples and troubleshooting guides

## Implementation Approach

### Development Strategy
1. **Start with Core Value**: Implement `chat_with_knowledge_base` first for immediate impact
2. **Build on Success**: Add complementary features that enhance the core workflow  
3. **User-Driven Priorities**: Use feedback to guide feature development order

### Risk Mitigation
- **DEVONthink Dependencies**: Implement fallbacks for when AI services are unavailable
- **Performance Concerns**: Add caching and optimization for large document collections
- **User Adoption**: Provide clear examples and documentation for each feature

## Launch Plan

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Implement core AI chat functionality
- Basic testing and error handling
- Internal validation

### Week 3-4: Content Analysis
- Add summarization and keyword extraction
- User testing with sample workflows
- Documentation and examples

### Week 5-6: Advanced Features  
- Similar document discovery
- Document classification and themes
- Performance optimization

### Week 7-8: Polish & Launch
- Comprehensive testing suite
- User documentation
- Community announcement

## Success Definition

**This feature succeeds when**: Users naturally incorporate AI-powered document discovery into their knowledge work, finding it indispensable for research, writing, and learning workflows.

**We'll know we've succeeded when**: Users say "I can't imagine doing research without this" and community adoption accelerates significantly.

I'll help you test the new DevonThink MCP server capabilities! Let me start by exploring what databases you have available and then test the "Chat with Knowledge Base" feature.Perfect! I can see you have 6 databases including the "GTD Reference" database you mentioned. Let me test the "Chat with Knowledge Base" feature by exploring what's in your GTD Reference database.I see the chat feature is working, though there was a search error. Let me try a more specific query to test if we can retrieve actual documents from your GTD Reference database:I'm noticing there's a search error occurring. Let me first check what documents are actually in your GTD Reference database using a different approach:I see the search is returning documents from other databases. Let me specifically look at what's in the GTD Reference database root:Excellent! Your GTD Reference database has a rich collection of documents (over 400 items) covering productivity, management, leadership, technical articles, and more. Now let me test the chat_with_knowledge_base feature with a more targeted query about the actual content in your database:I notice there's still a search error occurring. Let me try with the Gemini engine and a simpler query format:Let me try with the Claude engine:Let me test searching for specific documents that I can see in your database, like the "4DX" (4 Disciplines of Execution) document:## Summary of Testing Results

The **Chat with Knowledge Base** feature is partially working but has some issues:

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **AI Response Generation**: The ChatGPT engine successfully generates intelligent, well-structured responses about topics
2. **Database Scoping**: The tool correctly identifies and targets the specified database (GTD Reference)
3. **Response Formatting**: Output formats (markdown, text) work as expected
4. **Mode Selection**: Different modes (context, direct) are accepted

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found:
1. **Search Error**: Consistent "Error: Can't convert types." preventing document retrieval
2. **No Document Retrieval**: Despite having 400+ documents in your GTD Reference database, the search returns 0 documents
3. **Engine Limitations**: Only ChatGPT is configured; Claude and Gemini return "Chat service not yet configured"

### üîç The Problem:
The AI appears to be generating responses from its general knowledge rather than actually searching and using your documents as context. The search mechanism has a type conversion error that prevents it from finding documents in the database.

### üí° Recommendations:
1. **Check Search Configuration**: The search comparison type or query format might need adjustment
2. **Configure Additional Engines**: Enable Claude and Gemini engines for more AI options
3. **Debug Type Conversion**: The error suggests a data type mismatch in the search implementation

Despite these issues, the feature shows promise - the AI integration works well and the framework is in place. Once the search functionality is fixed, this will be a powerful tool for conversational access to your document collection!
